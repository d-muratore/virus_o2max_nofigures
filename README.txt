These scripts will reproduce figures and analyses conducted on local machines (HPC clusters required for bioinformatic analyses, data products that are locally readable are provided in the figshare with data files) for this project. Please start all code replications by running load_libraries.R, which will load all dependencies and initialize figure aesthetic settings. cruise_ctd_data.R will analyze CTD data products from the AE1926 Sargasso Sea cruise that are used to create main text Figure 1. bats_reanalysis.R (Note this script uses the package 'reticulate' which allows for R execution of the python library Gibbs Seawater Toolbox - please update the code with a conda or python environment that has this library installed (https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-Python/) will then reanalyze BATS cruise data downloaded from the BIOS data portal and conduct the analyses necessary to reproduce main text Figure 2, main text Figure 3, and Supplemental Figure 2. virus_scaling.R will conduct the reanalysis of the Parsons et al. BATS VLP count data presented in supplemental using the results of bats_reanalysis.R. molecular_figures.R will reproduce all remaining figures in the text based on metatranscriptome, flow cytometry, and polony/ipolony data. Each figure has data files with the appropriately processed bioinformatic data product, these are available on the figshare described above. For questions about code implementation or versioning, please contact Daniel Muratore dmuratore[at]santafe[dot]edu. 2
